# Weather App

Minimalistic weather application. The frontend will be developed in Flutter/Dart, displaying weather information based on user input. The backend, written in JavaScript, will fetch data from a weather API and relay it to the frontend.

Simple User Interface: Design a basic UI where users can input a city name.
Display Weather Data: Show temperature and general weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy) retrieved from the backend.

## Frontend

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## Backend

Go to backend folder and start with 'node server.js', server will be running on port 3001.
